<h2>A New Pocket Gopher (Thomomys) and a New Spiny<br />
Pocket Mouse (Liomys) from Michoac&aacute;n, Mexico</h2>

<h4>By</h4>

<h3>E. RAYMOND HALL and BERNARDO VILLA R.</h3>


<p>A series of 17 pocket gophers of the species <i>Thomomys umbrinus</i>
obtained in 1943 from points 3, 4 and 5 miles south of P&aacute;tzcuaro
proves upon comparison to be an hitherto unrecognized subspecies
which is described and named as follows:</p>


<p class="center"><b>Thomomys umbrinus pullus</b>, new subspecies</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Male, adult, skin and skull; No. 100151, Univ. California Mus. Vert.
Zool.; 5 mi. S P&aacute;tzcuaro, 7800 ft., Michoac&aacute;n, Mexico; March 10, 1943; obtained
by Hubert H. Hall, original No. 117.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Known only from 3 to 5 miles south of P&aacute;tzcuaro, Michoac&aacute;n.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;Size small (see measurements); color black or between Cinnamon-Brown
and Snuff Brown; distal half of tail whitish and all of tail whitish
in one specimen; lambdoidal crests perpendicular to sagittal plane of skull;
posteroventral face of tympanic bulla rugose; jugal vertical (flat surface not
oblique); interpterygoid space truncate at apex with sides curved outward
(see figure).</p>

<p><i>Comparison.</i>&mdash;From topotypes of <i>Thomomys umbrinus supernus</i> Nelson and
Goldman, <i>pullus</i> differs as follows: More individuals wholly black (except
distal half of tail); underparts lacking white; rostrum broader; braincase anteriorly
slightly more expanded dorsally; lambdoidal crests perpendicular to
sagittal plane rather than inclined posteromediad; interparietal broader, &#9794; 5.7
(5.0-7.0) versus 4.5, and in &#9792; 6.5 (5.6-7.1) rather than 4.8 (4.4-5.1); flattened
middle part of jugal vertical rather than oblique; in side view, mastoid and
paroccipital processes farther apart thus exposing larger surface of mastoidal
bulla; incisors, in both upper and lower jaws, slightly narrower; molariform
teeth smaller, interpterygoid space truncate, at apex, with sides convex mediad,
rather than V-shaped; ventral face of tympanic bullae rugose in posterior half
rather than smooth.</p></div>

umbrinus pullus</i>. &times; 1.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Among named subspecies of <i>Thomomys umbrinus</i>,
<i>T. u. pullus</i> most closely resembles <i>T. u. supernus</i>, the subspecies
next adjacent to the northward. Therefore, the results of comparisons
with only that subspecies are here reported upon. <i>T. u. tolucae</i>
to the eastward is for one thing a much larger animal and has
slightly less procumbent upper incisors. So far as we know, <i>Thomomys
umbrinus</i> has not heretofore been reported from Michoac&aacute;n.
Of our seventeen skins, eight are brown, six are black and two are
intermediate in color.</p>

<p>Most of these pocket gophers lived where there was a good growth
of pine trees in the same areas where large pocket gophers of the
species <i>Cratogeomys gymnurus</i> occurred. The field notes of the collector
of the type of <i>T. u. pullus</i> record that when he was making a
shallow excavation to reveal the gopher burrow in which he trapped
the holotype, he found the burrow approximately five inches below
the surface of the ground and that in digging deeper than was necessary
he accidentally broke into the burrow of a <i>Cratogeomys</i>.
Another member of our field party (E. R. Hall) when removing
from its burrow a trapped <i>Thomomys</i> that was caught only by the
hind leg, dug around the animal whose burrow was approximately
six inches underground and in doing so he also broke through the
roof of a burrow of <i>Cratogeomys</i>. The burrow of <i>Cratogeomys</i> was
approximately sixteen inches below the ground. Nowhere else, except
3 to 5 miles south of P&aacute;tzcuaro, have the authors found two
kinds of pocket gophers living together. The two-story arrangement
south of P&aacute;tzcuaro was possible because of the different levels at
which the two kinds of animals made their burrows and the two-story
arrangement was accidental and exceptional rather than the
rule.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;Average and extreme measurements of five adults of each
sex, are as follows: Total length, male 184 (178-198), female 185 (174-194);
length of tail, 54 (48-60), 53 (47-57); length of hind foot, 26.8 (25-29), 27.6
(26-29); weight, 86.1 (78.7-96.9), 74.3 (70.2-84.8) grams; basilar length, 30.2
(28.8-31.3), 28.6 (27.8-29.1); zygomatic breadth, 23.2 (22.3-24.6), 21.3 (20.8-21.8);
least interorbital breadth, 5.9 (5.8-6.1), 6.4 (6.0-6.8); mastoid breadth, 17.8
(17.1-18.7), 17.2 (16.6-17.5); length of nasals, 12.4 (11.8-13.0), 11.5 (11.0-12.5);
breadth of rostrum, 7.5 (6.9-8.2), 7.1 (6.9-7.3); length of rostrum, 14.1 (13.4-14.5),
13.3 (12.7-13.5); alveolar length of maxillary tooth-row, 7.0 (6.7-7.5), 6.9 (6.8-7.0);
palato-frontal depth, 13.2 (13.0-13.4), 12.9 (12.3-13.5).</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Total, 17, all from 7800 ft., Michoac&aacute;n, as follows:
3 mi. S P&aacute;tzcuaro, 1; 4 mi. S P&aacute;tzcuaro, 10; 5 mi. S P&aacute;tzcuaro, 6.</p></div>

<p>In 1943 a series of fifteen spiny pocket mice, <i>Liomys irroratus</i>,
was obtained within a radius of five miles of P&aacute;tzcuaro and, mostly
on geographic considerations, the animals were assigned to <i>Liomys
irroratus alleni</i> (Coues). In fact, in his "Revision of the Spiny
Pocket Mice," Goldman (N. Amer. Fauna, 34:57, 1911) had thus
identified the one specimen available to him from P&aacute;tzcuaro. Critical
examination of the series, however, revealed cranial features not
described in the named kinds from adjoining geographic areas, and
comparisons showed that the animal from P&aacute;tzcuaro differs subspecifically
from any named kind. The new subspecies may be
known as:</p>


<p class="center"><b>Liomys irroratus acutus</b>, new subspecies</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Female, adult, skin and skull; No. 100171, Univ. California Mus.
Vert. Zool.; 2 mi. W. P&aacute;tzcuaro, 7700 ft., Michoac&aacute;n, Mexico; March 10, 1943;
obtained by E. R. Hall and J. R. Alcorn, original No. 3837 of Alcorn.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Known only from the vicinity of P&aacute;tzcuaro, Michoac&aacute;n.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;Size large (see measurements); upper parts dark brown; posterior
border of nasals V-shaped with apex directed anteriorly; frontomaxillary
suture medially concave or rarely straight; interparietal subcircular; basisphenoid
wide; tympanic bullae large.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From <i>Liomys irroratus alleni</i>, <i>acutus</i> differs as follows: Color
slightly darker brown on upper parts; size slightly less; posterior border of
nasals V-shaped rather than truncate; frontomaxillary suture medially concave
or straight instead of convex; interparietal subcircular (anterior border) rather
than triangular; basisphenoid broader; tympanic bullae larger and more inflated.
From <i>Liomys irroratus jaliscensis</i> (topotypes), <i>acutus</i> differs as follows:
Color slightly darker brown on upper parts; size larger, without overlap, in
external measurements and in basilar length, length of nasals and mastoid
breadth; posterior border of nasals V-shaped rather than almost truncate;
frontomaxillary suture medially concave or straight rather than convex; interparietal
subcircular rather than quadrilateral; basisphenoid wider; tympanic
bullae larger. From <i>Liomys irroratus pullus</i>, <i>acutus</i> differs in longer body,
shorter tail, slightly longer hind foot; all of upper parts, and especially upper
side of tail, more brownish and less blackish; posterior border of nasals and
frontomaxillary suture differing in same way as from <i>alleni</i>; interorbital region
narrower in relation to length of skull; over-all length of skull greater; interparietal
anteroposteriorly longer; tympanic bullae more inflated.</p></div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This relatively large, dark-colored, spiny pocket mouse
of east-central Michoac&aacute;n differs from its geographic neighbors in
V-shape of posterior border of nasals, semicircular shape of interparietal,
medially concave maxillofrontal suture, wide basisphenoid
and larger tympanic bullae. The latter character is not constant.
Intergradation with <i>L. i. alleni</i> is shown by specimens from Querendaro
in which the shape of the interparietal is exactly intermediate
between those of topotypes of the two subspecies and also in that
the basisphenoid is wider than in <i>acutus</i> but narrower than in <i>alleni</i>.
Intergradation with <i>L. i. jaliscensis</i> is shown, by specimen No.
120275 (U. S. N. M.) from Zamora, in shape of posterior end of
nasals, direction of maxillofrontal suture, and shape of interparietal.
In each of these features the specimen from Zamora is almost exactly
intermediate between <i>acutus</i> and <i>jaliscensis</i>. In large size of
tympanic bullae and wider basisphenoid the specimen agrees with
<i>acutus</i>, but otherwise is nearly as small as <i>jaliscensis</i> to which it is
here referred. Actually the specimen could, with almost equal propriety,
be referred to either subspecies.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;The measurements of two males, Nos. 100184, 100182, and
average and extreme measurements of five females, are, respectively, as follows:
Total length, 257, 267, 244 (230-251); length of tail, 130, 128, 122 (105-129);
length of hind foot, 32, 31, 31 (30-33); length of ear from notch, 16, 17,
15.3 (13.0-19); weight in grams, 71.5, 65.1, 50.8 (44.8-61.8); greatest length of
skull, 35.2, 34.9, 33.6 (32.7-34.2); zygomatic breadth, 17.7, 17.5, 16.5 (16.1-17.1);
interorbital breadth, 8.4, 8.1, 7.8 (7.5-8.0); length of nasals, 15.1, 14.9, 14.0
(13.3-14.5); width of braincase, 15.9, 15.1, 15.0 (14.7-15.1); alveolar length of
upper molariform tooth-row, 6.0, 6.0, 5.6 (5.5-5.9). The measurements were
taken according to the method of Goldman (N. Amer. Fauna, 34:10, 1911).
Each of the specimens of which measurements are given above is adult; the
transverse enamel fold has been obliterated in M1, is represented by only an
isolated lake in M2 (except in one female where all trace of the fold has worn
away) and is present in M3.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Total, 16, all from Michoac&aacute;n, Mexico, and unless
otherwise indicated in the University of California Museum of Vertebrate
Zo&ouml;logy, as follows: 3 mi. NW P&aacute;tzcuaro, 6700 ft., 1; 2 mi. W P&aacute;tzcuaro,
7700 ft., 5; 2 mi. W P&aacute;tzcuaro, 6700 ft., 2; P&aacute;tzcuaro, 1 (U. S. Nat. Mus.);
5 mi. S P&aacute;tzcuaro, 7800 ft., 7.</p></div>
